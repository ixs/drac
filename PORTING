This package has only been compiled and tested under a small number
of Unix operating systems.  See the INSTALL file for details.
Other operating systems will require at least a review of the
Makefile settings.

rpc.dracd handles IP addresses internally as unsigned longs in network
byte order.  struct in_addr and the conversion functions inet_addr()
and inet_ntoa() are compatible with this format.  The IP address sent
over the RPC connection must be converted to host byte order before
being sent, and converted to network byte order after being received,
so as to work correctly on both big-endian and little-endian machines.

The following unportable code sections in rpc.dracd.c may need to be
conditionally-compiled for other systems.  Most of this is now
handled in the Makefile...

o Include files

o RPC server interface: svc_getreqset(), svc_fdset

o Obtaining the client IP address: svc_getrpccaller(), taddr2uaddr(),
	getnetconfigent(), freenetconfigent()

o Memory clearing and copying: memset(), memcpy()

o Convert string to unsigned long: strtoul()

o File locking: fcntl()

o Obtaining the local host name: sysinfo()
